## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces

### What I learned

I learned how to implement a custom dropdown menu without using <select> and <option> elements. This required managing state to show/hide the dropdown and using CSS positioning to control layout effectively.

### Continued development

I aim to further explore advanced CSS techniques and how they can enhance user interface design without heavy reliance on JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Reference for CSS attributes and React concepts
- [Kevin Powell's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb) - Great for learning practical CSS techniques and effects
